I think I have been coding for about three years now, maybe even longer. Ever since I graduated from a Front-end bootcamp, and I know that I have learned a lot since then. I have gone through learning different languages, frameworks, practices, concepts, and I don't regret anything I learned so far, but the one thing that I got into web development for, and the one thing that always really excited me was the ability to basically put a website together from nothing, and publish it for next to nothing. I would have complete creative freedom, could say whatever I wanted to say, make it look however I wanted it to look, and basically put together my own platforms at will. A lot of people in my field and position would be more interested in application development and in functionality, but honestly, my interests were always more content driven. I was always more interested in content and design, and how people used the website medium to create art, in essence, not necessarily for any purpose than expressing themselves.

So a lot of my plans revolved around plans for blogs or fansites dedicated to whatever interested my at the time, and its incredibly frustrating and disappointing that for all the time I spent idly fantasising about what I should build I have basically built nothing. I mean, laziness and procrastination have their own part in the explanation behind why I found it so hard to get started. I got into a cycle of waiting to learn that little bit more about this or that programming concept to really get started on working on the content, and then never feeling like I had anything interesting to say, getting intimidated by a blank page, putting things off, going back to learning about x or y, and finding it incredibly difficult break out of the cycle.

Even today, and after having put in a lot of time into learning to program and covering a lot of ground, I'm still dissatisfied with the current state of my skills. Of everthing that I have worked on, I think I grew the most on the backend, and my front-end and CSS is probably weakest. It's extremely fair to say that I have spread myself way too thin.

And of course, you don't need to be a fully-fledged web-developer to make a blog. Anyone can do it. You should be able to do it with basic html, and css. In fact, on some platforms, you don't even need that. You definitely don't need a javascript framework to start writing articles, or stories, or to indulge in anything you find interesting. Well really, for a long time I didn't know what I found interesting. I threw myself into technical challenges to avoid dealing with creative ones.

And so, it is with a mixture of excitement and jealousy that I started looking through some of the popular sites on Neocities. It's inspiring looking at a lot of the creativity that's on offer. So I just thought that while I am still scrouging around for topics and ideas to really start trying to find the means to express myself creatively and consistently, that it would be a nice idea to take few of them, and to try to put into words what I think of them and what I like about them so much, and to actively document the search for inspiration as I go through them. One thing to point out up front, is that these aren't supposed to be reviews or anything critical. These are intended to be almost wholly to document and aid my own edification.

## Wired Sound for Wired People

[Wired Sound For Wired People](https://fauux.neocities.org) is the first one that I found and the first one that I'll cover. I found it having just rewatched _Serial Experiments Lain_ and looking for anything related to that.

This isn't a new site by any means, although it's still being updated, there was a new puzzle put up last month, which is evidently still waiting to be solved. And for that matter, I don't think that this is particularly obscure. It's one of the most popular on neocities for sure, and I think that quite a few people who enjoy SEL online are probably aware of this.

It's not a huge site, but there is definitely enough content here, and an impressive amount of artwork. The homepage informs the user that "You are invisible" and offers link to help them switch modes, but which takes the user through a gallery of full-page gifs one with only a single link to the next gif embedded into it.

There is a tracklist with a whole host of cool tracks for which the gifs from the the "Go visible" track form the background. Most of the tracks seem really trippy, or sad, fitting in with the "make me sad" tagline from the main menu. One thing that's really cool is there is a Downloads page with a bunch of lain related wallpapers (One of which I'm sporting on my desktop right now) and some game scenarios.

There is also a section of site that you can log into called Wired 2.0. I have no idea what that is about. Apparently you need an invite from someone else who is a member to log in. Perhaps it has something to do with the puzzles. Clicking on help and guidelines takes the user to another page which describes several Lain-world themed user types like "Virtual Ghost."

## What I like about it

Let's get to it. What do I like about this and what does it say to me?

A big part of it is the aesthetic. It has a really dark lo-fi look to everything, that I think looks amazing. In a site more closely follows fuction over form the tracking in the typography would be off-putting, but I think it really adds something, where the font is kept on the default browser font and so looks vaguely familiar but the spacing and color adds this hint of strangeness and something else to it.

The gif art direction seems to be (along with the music) one of the main focuses of the site and I think they are all amazing, from the smooth and understated elements on the homepage title, to the jarring and static-y elements from the larger full page gifs. One of the ways that I found this inspiring is simply to acknowledge that for all that goes into a website, and all that you can do using css, in the end what you can do in photoshop or illustrator is huge as well. I'm not an artist, and I think this year I will try my hand at more of this, but I am unlikely to be very successful at it anytime soon. But getting my hands dirty producing assets is something that I really want to try. It's something that I think this site does insanely well.

But I'm sure that people and other sites have great artwork and art-direction. Part of what makes this site special I think goes beyond even an aesthetic, but the art and everything on the site wraps itself up in this mythos. I think that's what I like the most about the site. Part, but only part of this is borrowed from the Lain mythos, but it has definitely built upon the inspiration and added to it. It really feels like they took the lain universe and ran with it.

It really feels like a site meant for another darker universe, and has enough natural elements mixed in with the stylised ones to really bring it all to life. It feels like it has a heart-beat. It's dark. It feels a little occult, in that cool, old way that a lot of the internet used to feel. For something, that serves no visiable purpose than to make this universe come alive I'm a little in awe of the effort that it must have taken and the depth that the site feels like it has.

It's almost a perfect example of the passion project that I'd really like to emulate. Anyway, I'm a fan.
