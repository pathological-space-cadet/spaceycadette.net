> Two magicians made a blood oath when they were children that they would never harm each other. Now they are mortal enemies and have resorted to inconveniencing and annoying each other, knowing if they harm one another they'll die.

Rumors online continually swirl the grove, and every year draw tens and sometimes hundreds of visitors to the twin villages near the grove site. But at the eye, the air is suffocatingly still; it is an air not meant for mortals polluted as it is with the stale mush of lost centuries, of old magicks and cantankerous hatred.

While positioned on temperate lowland, the locals there have more in commmon with those peoples who make their home where no others can live. As a rule they are hardier, more enduring, and focus easily and exclusively on the chore of getting on with things; generally, they tend to be sullen, with a dislike of any extra chatter. They are the decendants of those who couldn't outrun their homeland's fall; they are doomed to long memories. From their forefathers they have inherited a scrupulously indirect fashion of dicussing the poison that haunts where they live. The old masters haunt the space between what is said and left unsaid, and so they are everywhere.

The only other residents are a colony of academics who come to study the old ruins. Fresh faces come to unearth the mysteries, but soon join the college of those who know. They study quietly and even publish quietly, restricting output to only the driest they dig up.

Likewise, tourists come to be managed by courteous locals. The rumors draw them in, while they buzz with excitement. But they always leave much changed for the quieter and thus only whispers escape to draw the next crowd into orbit.

Around the grove, the echoes of occult history ring deafening and dampen all else, except a profound feeling of disquiet. The old war is only alive for two; the grove exists for the long war; it is never acknowledged but a truth notched into the gut of every living thing that has trodden the land; that it is the domain of the old masters.
